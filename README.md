# CryptoHackathon - Make Functional Encryption the new Standard 

To ease the deployment of functional encryption technologies, two APIsI - [CiFEr](https://github.com/fentec-project/CiFEr) (C) and [GoFE](https://github.com/fentec-project/gofe) (Go lang) - have been developed within the EU H2020 project [FENTEC](http://fentec.eu/) so that non-specialist may leverage the power of many state-of-the-art FE schemes. With this hackathon, we want to show the practicability and versatility of FE and reduce the entry barrier for researchers, engineers, product owners, architects to deploy FE in their solutions, ranging from prototypes to enterprise-ready products.

## Agenda

**Intro Workshop (Fri 8th Jan)**: We will give an introduction to functional encryption for a broad audience ranging from theoreticians to practitioners. It is also a good entry for newbies. No prior knowledge on FE is necessary. The goal of the invited talks will be to introduce the theory, applications and limitations of functional encryption. We will also explain the FE API developed in the H2020 FENTEC project that allows participants to implement novel use cases leveraging the functional encryption paradigm. Towards the end of the talks we will announce some challenges to attendees along the opportunity to win prizes.

**Hackathon (Sat 9th to Thur 14th Jan)**: Attendees may team up in order to work on the challenges. Mentors both from academia and industry will help attendees with questions regarding the theory of functional encryption, the deployment of the API, or the identification of meaningful use cases.

**Demo Day (Fri 15th Jan)**: Teams will give a short presentation (10-15min) of their results. A jury will pick the winners.

## Judging Criteria

**Technical Execution:**
* How has the team effectively utilized the FE technologies?
* How easy is the application to use?
* How advanced is the prototype presented?
* Is there a working demo?
* Is the project well documented (e.g. readme, wiki) such that follow up work is possible?

**Challenge Fit:**
* How relevant is the project to the stated challenge?

**Impact:**
* Will this solution have a far reach and market potential?
